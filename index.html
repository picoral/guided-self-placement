        <h1>Welcome to the Computer Science Guided Self-Placement!</h1>

        <p>
            We're excited that you are interested in taking an introductory computer science course! Our
            CSC 101 and CSC 110 programming courses</a> are designed for all students, regardless of how much prior experience you do or do not have and
            regardless of your goals or reasons for taking the course. In that spirit, we want everyone to take the right first course
            for them, especially since prior experience can come in many different forms. This self-placement will help you find that
            course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This self-placement is <em>adaptive</em>, meaning which questions you see and in which order will depend on your responses. So
            each student will have a slightly different experience, and if you go back and change your answers, you may see different questions
            appear. This is to help make sure we get the information that will most help us recommend the best course for you. As you go through
            the self-placement, you may also encounter terms or concepts you haven't heard of before. Don't be intimidated-- if you haven't seen
            a topic or concept, that just means you should probably be in the course that teaches it! We encourage you to answer all questions
            as truthfully as possible based on your <em>current</em> experience.

              This course is intended for students who have no prior programming experience. Several core concepts in computer science will be presented, including problem-solving techniques, data representation, logic, and the physical components of computer hardware. Students will leave this course with basic programming and problem-solving skills, increased technical literacy, and a greater ability to recognize problems that can be solved with technology.

              In Fall 2023, there will be three sections of CSC 110:
              <ul>
                <li>1pm taught by Xinchen Yu are for students who have some previous coding experience</li>

                Since you have taken a CSC course before, you should take CSC 110 1pm for students with some previous experience in coding, or CSC 110 at 2pm.

CSC 120 provides a continuing introduction to programming with an emphasis on problem solving. It considers problems drawn from a variety of domains (including Computer Science) and emphasizes both the broader applicability of the relevant data structures and programming concepts, as well as the implementation of those structures and concepts in software. Topics include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, searching and sorting, and exceptions.

              The different sections for different students (those with coding experience vs. those new to coding) are all the same difficulty, and have the same learning objectives. This distinction in sections does not mean that any section is harder or easier than the others -- all assessment (including assignments and exams) are the same.

                Although you have some previous programming experience, it sounds like you're still not entirely confident with some
                topics. <b>We recommend you take CSC 110 1pm with Adriana Picoral or CSC 110 2pm with Xinchen Yu</b> to help you solidfy your understanding of that material.

              In Fall 2023, there will be three sections of CSC 110:
              <ul>
                <li>1pm taught by Xinchen Yu are for students who have some previous coding experience</li>
                <li>1pm taught by Adriana Picoral are for students who are new to coding</li>
                <li>2pm taught by Xinchen Yu assumes no previous coding experience, and both students who have some coding experience and students new to coding are welcome to attend this section</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

                Since you have some experience with coding, <b>you should take CSC 110 at 1pm with Xinchen Yu or CSC 110 at 2pm</b>.
