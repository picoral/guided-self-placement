        <h1>Welcome to the Computer Science Guided Self-Placement!</h1>

        <p>
            We're excited that you are interested in taking an introductory computer science course! Our
            CSC 101 and CSC 110 programming courses</a> are designed for all students, regardless of how much prior experience you do or do not have and
            regardless of your goals or reasons for taking the course. In that spirit, we want to help students chose the first course that is best for them, especially since prior experience can come in many different forms. This self-placement will help you find that
            course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This self-placement is <em>adaptive</em>, meaning which questions you see and in which order will depend on your responses. So
            each student will have a slightly different experience, and if you go back and change your answers, you may see different questions
            appear. This is to help make sure we get the information that will most help us recommend the best course for you. As you go through
            the self-placement, you may also encounter terms or concepts you haven't heard of before. Don't be intimidated-- if you haven't seen
            a topic or concept, that just means you should probably be in the course that teaches it! We encourage you to answer all questions
            as truthfully as possible based on your <em>current</em> experience.

                Since you do not have college algebra, <b>you should take CSC 101 Introduction to Computer Science</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course is intended for students who have no prior programming experience. Several core concepts in computer science will be presented, including problem-solving techniques, data representation, logic, and the physical components of computer hardware. Students will leave this course with basic programming and problem-solving skills, increased technical literacy, and a greater ability to recognize problems that can be solved with technology.

            <p>
              In Fall 2024, there will be three sections of CSC 110:
              <ul>
                <li>Section 001 - 1pm taught by Adriana Picoral is for students who are new to coding</li>
                <li>Section 002 - 1pm taught by Xinchen Yu is for students who have some previous coding experience</li>
                <li>Section 003 - 2pm taught by Xinchen Yu assumes no previous coding experience, and both students who have some coding experience and students new to coding are welcome to attend this section</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              The different sections for different students (those with coding experience vs. those new to coding) are all the same difficulty, and have the same learning objectives and outcomes. This distinction in sections does not mean that any section is harder or easier than the others -- all assessments (including assignments and exams) are the same.

            <p>CSC 110 Introduction to Computer Programming for students who are new to coding (Sections 001 or 003)</p>
            <p>
              In Fall 2024, there will be three sections of CSC 110:
              <ul>
                <li>Section 001 - 1pm taught by Adriana Picoral is for students who are new to coding</li>
                <li>Section 002 - 1pm taught by Xinchen Yu is for students who have some previous coding experience</li>
                <li>Section 003 - 2pm taught by Xinchen Yu assumes no previous coding experience, and both students who have some coding experience and students new to coding are welcome to attend this section</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              The different sections for different students (those with coding experience vs. those new to coding) are all the same difficulty, and have the same learning objectives and outcomes. This distinction in sections does not mean that any section is harder or easier than the others -- all assessments (including assignments and exams) are the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since you are new to coding, <b>we recommend you take or switch into CSC 110 1pm with Adriana Picoral (Section 001  - for students who are new to coding) or 2pm with Xinchen Yu (Section 003 - for all students)</b>.
            </p>

                Since you have a satisfactory AP score, <b>you are allowed to enroll in CSC 120 Introduction to Computer Programming II</b>. Note that CSC 110 and CSC 120 are both taught in Python. You might consider taking CSC 110 instead, which provides an introduction to Python. If you do not have any experience with Python we recommend you take CSC 110 instead.

CSC 120 provides a continuing introduction to programming in Python with an emphasis on problem solving. It considers problems drawn from a variety of domains (including Computer Science) and emphasizes both the broader applicability of the relevant data structures and programming concepts, as well as the implementation of those structures and concepts in software. Topics include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, searching and sorting, and exceptions.

                Although you have some previous programming experience, it sounds like you're still not entirely confident with some
                topics. <b>We recommend you take or switch into CSC 110 1pm with Adriana Picoral (Section 001 - for students who are new to coding) or CSC 110 2pm with Xinchen Yu (Section 003 - for all students)</b> to help you solidfy your understanding of that material.
